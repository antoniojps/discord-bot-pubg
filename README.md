### Usage

The first thing a user must do is link their discord account to a pubg account by linking them, this will assign him roles according to stats and rank, once that's done he can join the rooms according to stats. He can also use the LFS channel with a more detailed embed.

### 1. Link

`/link PUBG_NAME`

This command will fetch the users stats directly from the PUBG API there's a minimum of 20 games required in order to provide the roles.

`/link PUBG_NAME DISCORD_ID`

Admin command, same as previous but assigns the stats of the PUBG_NAME to the user of the DISCORD_ID. Used to avoid false linking.

**Roles**
| Role(s) | Description |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| `Bronze`, `Silver`, `Gold`, `Platinum`, `Diamond`, `Master` | Role according to rank. |
| `KD 0.5`, `KD 1`, `KD 1.5`, `KD 2`, `KD 2.5`, `KD 3`, `KD 3.5`, `KD 4`, `KD 4.5`, `KD 5`, `KD +6` | Role according to KD. |
| `100 ADR`, `150 ADR`, `200 ADR`, `250 ADR`, `300 ADR`, `350 ADR`, `400 ADR`, `450 ADR`, `500 ADR`, `+550 ADR` | Role according to ADR. |

### 2. Looking for someone

`lfs`

By typing `lfs` on the `looking-for-someone` channel the bot will create a LFS Embed, if someone reacts with a `✉️` it will send a PM to the author of the `lfs` with the request, the author can accept or decline the request and the interested party will be notified with a PM.

### 3. Help

`/help`

Typing `help` on any channel the bot will delete the message sent by the user, create an Embed with a guide to all the bot commands and send it via PM.
